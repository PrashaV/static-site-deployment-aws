## Step-by-step guide on how I deployed the site using AWS S3 + CloudFront

## Pre-requisites 
An AWS account (Free-tier) 
A HTML file (e.g., portfolio.html linked below)

## Step 1: Set up an Amazon S3 Bucket for Static Hosting

1. Navigate to Amazon S3 Console > Click ‚ÄúCreate Bucket‚Äù
- Enter a unique Bucket Name (e.g., your-bucket-name)
- Choose a preferred AWS Region (ideally close to your location)
- Uncheck ‚ÄúBlock All Public Access‚Äù to allow public access to website files

2. Open your newly created bucket and upload your website files (index.html, style.css, etc.)

3. Go to the Properties tab and scroll to Static website hosting
- Click Edit, enable static website hosting
- Ensure index.html is uploaded to the root level of the bucket (not inside a folder)
- Copy the Website endpoint URL ‚Äî this will serve as your website‚Äôs publicly accessible address

## Step 2: Set Bucket Policy for Public Read Access

Go to **Permissions > Bucket Policy** tab and paste:(replace your-bucket-name)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}

## Step 3: Create a CloudFront Distribution

1. Open the **CloudFront Console** and click ‚ÄúCreate Distribution‚Äù

2. Under Origin domain, select your S3 static website endpoint (CloudFront will auto-fill the name)

3. Origin Shield: Leave disabled

4. Scroll through the Default cache behavior ‚Äî you can keep the default settings for a simple setup

5. **Web Application Firewall** (WAF): Optional, you can skip this unless you want advanced security

6. Click ‚ÄúCreate Distribution‚Äù

Once deployed, your website will be available globally via a secure HTTPS CloudFront domain, such as: https://d12345678.cloudfront.net

## Deployment Summary
1. **Created S3 Bucket** with static website hosting enabled
2. **Uploaded index.html** to the root of the bucket
3. Configured **bucket policy** for public read access
4. **Deployed CloudFront Distribution**, linked to the S3 bucket
5. Set up **HTTPS via ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager)**
6. Tested site accessibility through CloudFront domain

---

## Highlights
- Hosted a static website with Amazon S3
- Configured secure public access to the S3 bucket using a tailored bucket policy
- Enabled global content delivery and caching using Amazon CloudFront to reduce latency and improve load times
- Configured HTTPS encryption via CloudFront for secure, scalable access to the static website across all regions
- Deployed a website without the need for a traditional backend or web server
